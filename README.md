# Hello World, I'm Emily 👋

I'm currently a software engineer intern at Snap 👻 (prev at Apple  and Microsoft (x2)), and am also in my third year at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver, BC, studying Computer Science and Business Management. I'm fascinated by AR/VR, as well as the intersection between society, health care, and computing!
